**Project Title:**
*Explore Bikeshare Data*

**Description**

In this project, I used data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. I compared the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

**Files used**
1. chicago.csv
2. new-york-city.csv
3. washington.csv

**Credits**

I would like to acknowledge Udacity for providing the data and guidelines for this project.
